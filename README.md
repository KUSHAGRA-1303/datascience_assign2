1:-we can comment in python by '#' or by three single quotes. there are two types of comment in the python : a)single line comment:-we made comment through '#' b)multi line comment:- we made multi-line comment through three single quotes

2:- variable are the container that is used to store address of data . Python is very smart language and we donot need to declare the variable, we just need to assign values to the to the variable

3:-data types convert by two ways: 
Implicit Type Conversion:-In Implicit type conversion of data types in Python, the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without any user involvement. EX:-x = 10

print("x is of type:",type(x))

y = 10.6 print("y is of type:",type(y))

z = x + y

print(z) print("z is of type:",type(z)) IN above example z is alrady convereted into float because float have high priority

Explicit Type Conversion:-In this type of conversion we convert by typecasting.

ex:- a=10 if we want convert a into float then: float(a)

4:-open a command line and type the word python followed by the path to your script file like this: python first_script.py Hello World! Then you hit the ENTER

#5:-
my_list=[1,2,3,4,5]
​
t[1:3:1])
print(my_list[1:3:1])
[2, 3]
6:-complex number are those which contain both real number and imaginary number in python we represent by:- ex:-4+6j

7:- age=25

8:- price=9.99 it belong to float datatype.

#9:-
name="kushagra pandey"
print(name)
kushagra pandey
Hello, World!"
#10:-
string="Hello, World!"
​
)
print(string[7:12:1])
